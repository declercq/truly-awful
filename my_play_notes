Java Play Web Framework - setting up database and web/rest server on google app engine

downloaded play-2.2.1
already have openjdk-6-jdk installed
added play directory to path (not in .bashrc)

play new test-play-gae 
	(creates the dir, fails if it already exists)

	made it a git repo (checked in initial play setup)

play idea 
	setup for import into intellij

good and simple rest on play example - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4379485/restful-on-play-framework

----

GAE module only works for play1.x
Going to try Heroku instead
    http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.0/ProductionHeroku

    heroku cmd line tool had already been installed 
    
$ heroku create
Creating arcane-retreat-7197... done, stack is cedar
http://arcane-retreat-7197.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:arcane-retreat-7197.git
Git remote heroku added

----

plan 3 - use AWS Elastic Beanstalk 
	should be simpler than Heroku (built on top of AWS)
	basically provides web server + distributed database access (exactly what we need)

default java app server: 
	Elastic Beanstalk will create a 
		load-balancing
		autoscaling 
		Tomcat 7 
		Java 7 
		64bit Amazon Linux 2013.09

Play Framework Notes

	play run - run application/server locally (accessible via http://localhost:9000/)

producing a war file (needed for AWS EB)
	requires a plugin and some configuration

(signed up for aws)
	activated multi-factor auth (google authenticator)
