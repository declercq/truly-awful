Hosting options
	Google App Engine (GAE)
		platform as a service
		autoscales, etc
		GAE module only works for play1.x, no support for play 2x

	Heroku 
		built on top of AWS
		http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.0/ProductionHeroku
		may be useful, but a bit more complex than necessary at the moment

	AWS Elastic Beanstalk 
		should be simpler than Heroku (built on top of AWS)
		basically provides web server + distributed database access (exactly what we need)
		auto scales unlike base AWS

		default java app server: 
			Elastic Beanstalk will create a 
				load-balancing
				autoscaling 
				Tomcat 7 
				Java 7 
				64bit Amazon Linux 2013.09

		(signed up for aws) - activated multi-factor auth (google authenticator)
